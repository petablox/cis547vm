Follow these instructions to fill in the table below:

You are provided a suite of 15 C programs in directory lab1/test/ of
the course VM.  Each program contains a single division instruction.

First, inspect the code of each program, and fill in its ground truth
(Good/Bad) in the Ground Truth column: 

- Good if the program does not contain any divide-by-zero errors.
- Bad if the program contains a divide-by-zero error.

Next, run your analyzer on each program and fill in its result
(Accept/Reject) in the Analysis Result column:

- Accept if your analyzer does not report any divide-by-zero errors.
- Reject if your analyzer reports a divide-by-zero error.

Lastly, use the above computed results to calculate the Precision,
Recall, and F-Measure of your analyzer on this suite of programs.
